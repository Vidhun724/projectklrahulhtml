<h3 style=color:red>Early life and Education</h3>
<h4>Rahul spent his early years in Mangalore, where he began his schooling at the NITK English Medium School. He later moved to Bangalore to pursue his cricketing career more seriously, attending Jain University. From a young age, Rahul showed a keen interest in cricket, often playing in the local matches and representing his school and college teams.</h4>
<h3 style="color:red">Cricket Beginnings</h3>  
<h4>KL Rahul's cricketing journey began at a very young age. He joined the Bangalore United Cricket Club and trained under coach Samuel Jayaraj. His talent was evident early on, and he quickly progressed through the ranks of age-group cricket. By the age of 12, he was already playing for Karnataka in under-14 and under-16 matches, showcasing his potential as a future star.</h4>
<h3 style="color:red">Rise in Domestic Cricket</h3>
<h4>Rahul's breakthrough came when he represented Karnataka in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy. His consistent performances in domestic cricket earned him a spot in the India Under-19 team for the 2010 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. Although the team did not win the tournament, Rahul's performance was commendable, and it set the stage for his future career.</h4>
<h3 style="color:red">Debut and Struggles</h3>
<h4>After his stint with the Under-19 team, Rahul made his first-class debut for Karnataka in the 2010-11 season. Initially, he faced challenges in establishing himself, but his perseverance paid off. He scored heavily in domestic cricket, particularly in the 2013-14 season, where he amassed over 1,000 runs in the Ranji Trophy, helping Karnataka win the title.</h4>
<h3 style="color:red">International Breakthrough</h3>
<h4>KL Rahul's domestic success caught the attention of national selectors, and he made his Test debut for India in December 2014 against Australia in Melbourne. Although he had a shaky start, scoring only three runs in his debut match, he bounced back in the next Test with a century in Sydney. This performance marked the beginning of his international career.</h4>
<h3 style="color:red">IPL and Limited-Overs Cricket</h3>
<h4>In addition to his Test career, Rahul also made significant strides in limited-overs cricket. He was picked up by the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2013 and later played for teams like Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings). His versatility as a batsman and ability to adapt to different formats made him a valuable asset in T20 cricket.
